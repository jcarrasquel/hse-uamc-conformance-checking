### Project Description:

In this project, we research on novel conformance checking methods, which
use rich Petri net extension models, namely Colored Petri Nets and Nested Petri Nets.
Traditionally, standard conformance checking methods merely focus on the validation of system's control-flow
(e.g., whether systems comply certain causal dependences between activities). Tackling such limitation, we focus
on the development on more clever approaches that can validate correct processing of data resources, as well
as correct agent interaction. The mentioned Petri net extension models allow to formally specify such agent- and
data-related aspects that a system shall comply. Then, with our methods, we aim to sistematically compare these kinds of 
Petri net models (expected behavior) again event logs, which record the observed behavior of systems.
